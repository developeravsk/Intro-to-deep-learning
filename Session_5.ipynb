    "Differentiation is a crucial step in nearly all deep learning optimization algorithms. While the calculations for taking these derivatives are straightforward, requiring only some basic calculus, for complex models, working out the updates by hand can be a pain (and often error-prone).\n",

    "Deep learning frameworks expedite this work by automatically calculating derivatives, i.e., automatic differentiation. In practice, based on our designed model the system builds a computational graph, tracking which data combined through which operations to produce the output. Automatic differentiation enables the system to subsequently backpropagate gradients. Here, backpropagate simply means to trace through the computational graph, filling in the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter."

    "Before we even calculate the gradient of  y  with respect to  x , we will need a place to store it. It is important that we do not allocate new memory every time we take a derivative with respect to a parameter because we will often update the same parameters thousands or millions of times and could quickly run out of memory. Note that a gradient of a scalar-valued function with respect to a vector  x  is itself vector-valued and has the same shape as  x ."
